Request form example
```





### !!! Please see /readme.pdf file 



 It is an example of request form (stage 1) which needs to be a part of legacy system working on PHP 5.3.2, using:
   * Composer – PSR-4 (for project folder)
   * Twig – template engine
   * Eloquent – ORM and query builder
   * Phinx – db migrations
  
 Submited example of code only building form (Twig, Semantic-UI) based on configuration saved in database (names, lablels, tooltips, input filters, etc.). Saving form is not implemented on this stage. #
