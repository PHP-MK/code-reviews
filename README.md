# PHP Milton Keynes - Episode 4 // Code Reviews

In episode 4 we will focus on code reviews, and we will review code submitted to this repository.

## Submit Code For Review

If you'd like us to review your code during the meetup, then please do the following:

1. Fork the code reviews repository.
2. Add your code within a sensibly named folder to the root directory.
3. Send a pull request back to the PHP-MK code reviews master branch.

Please include a README.md in your folder that explains what the code does.

## Guidance

* Your code should be no larger than a small module and take no longer than 15 minutes maximum to review.
* Your code MUST NOT include any sensitive information that you would not be happy to share publicly.
